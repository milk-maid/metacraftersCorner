# ERC-20 Token

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a basic ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard defines a set of rules that a token contract must adhere to, allowing for seamless interaction with other Ethereum applications, such as wallets and decentralized exchanges.

## Features

- **Name:** [BellCR]
- **Symbol:** [CRB]
- **Decimals:** [18]]
- **Total Supply:** [unlimited]

## Smart Contract

The main smart contract file is located at [`./Token.sol`](./Token.sol). It includes the necessary functions and events required by the ERC-20 standard.

## Deployment

The token can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. Make sure to set the appropriate parameters such as the name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.

## Usage

To use this ERC-20 token, consider the following steps:

1. Deploy the token contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact with the token using Ethereum wallets or dApps.
3. Customize the token details as needed for your specific use case.

## Development

If you want to contribute or modify the token implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Make changes to the smart contract in `contracts/Token.sol`.
4. Test your changes: `npm test`
5. Deploy the updated contract to the Ethereum network.
